# Bachelor's Thesis

## Download

The thesis PDF file is autogenerated on each commit. You can check out the
latest version through the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xaviripo/tfgr/actions?query=workflow%3AThesis) section.

## Requirements

For generating the thesis itself, the following are necessary:

- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
- [XeLaTeX](https://www.tug.org/xetex/) (I use [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) XeTeX package)
- The [TeX Gyre Pagella](http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre),
[TeX Gyre Pagella Math](http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tg-math), and
[DejaVu Sans Mono](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/) fonts

To generate the thesis files, run:

```sh
$ make
```

at the root of the repository.
