	title = {The real projective spaces in homotopy type theory},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05770},
	abstract = {Homotopy type theory is a version of Martin-L{\textbackslash}"of type theory taking advantage of its homotopical models. In particular, we can use and construct objects of homotopy theory and reason about them using higher inductive types. In this article, we construct the real projective spaces, key players in homotopy theory, as certain higher inductive types in homotopy type theory. The classical definition of RP(n), as the quotient space identifying antipodal points of the n-sphere, does not translate directly to homotopy type theory. Instead, we define RP(n) by induction on n simultaneously with its tautological bundle of 2-element sets. As the base case, we take RP(-1) to be the empty type. In the inductive step, we take RP(n+1) to be the mapping cone of the projection map of the tautological bundle of RP(n), and we use its universal property and the univalence axiom to define the tautological bundle on RP(n+1). By showing that the total space of the tautological bundle of RP(n) is the n-sphere, we retrieve the classical description of RP(n+1) as RP(n) with an (n+1)-cell attached to it. The infinite dimensional real projective space, defined as the sequential colimit of the RP(n) with the canonical inclusion maps, is equivalent to the Eilenberg-MacLane space K(Z/2Z,1), which here arises as the subtype of the universe consisting of 2-element types. Indeed, the infinite dimensional projective space classifies the 0-sphere bundles, which one can think of as synthetic line bundles. These constructions in homotopy type theory further illustrate the utility of homotopy type theory, including the interplay of type theoretic and homotopy theoretic ideas.},

	abstract = {This paper continues investigations in "synthetic homotopy theory": the use of homotopy type theory to give machine-checked proofs of constructions from homotopy theory We present a mechanized proof of the Blakers-Massey connectivity theorem, a result relating the higher-dimensional homotopy groups of a pushout type (roughly, a space constructed by gluing two spaces along a shared subspace) to those of the components of the pushout. This theorem gives important information about the pushout type, and has a number of useful corollaries, including the Freudenthal suspension theorem, which has been studied in previous formalizations. The new proof is more elementary than existing ones in abstract homotopy-theoretic settings, and the mechanization is concise and high-level, thanks to novel combinations of ideas from homotopy theory and type theory.},

	abstract = {Homotopy type theory is a recent research area connecting type theory with homotopy theory by interpreting types as spaces. In particular, one can prove and mechanize type-theoretic analogues of homotopy-theoretic theorems, yielding “synthetic homotopy theory”. Here we consider the Seifert–van Kampen theorem, which characterizes the loop structure of spaces obtained by gluing. This is useful in homotopy theory because many spaces are constructed by gluing, and the loop structure helps distinguish distinct spaces. The synthetic proof showcases many new characteristics of synthetic homotopy theory, such as the “encode-decode” method, enforced homotopy-invariance, and lack of underlying sets.},
