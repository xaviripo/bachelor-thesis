## The Blakers-Massey Connectivity Theorem

We have seen how to compute the fundamental group of a space out of its subspaces.
It turns out, though, that the same is not true for higher homotopy groups.
In fact, the best approximation we have obtained so far for this problem does not allow computing the higher homotopy groups of spaces, but rather, it just gives information on the connectivity of such spaces--a property that only relies on the triviality of its homotopy groups.
This is the Blakers-Massey connectivity theorem.
