## The Seifert-van Kampen Theorem

We have now seen an invariant of topological spaces (the fundamental group), and a way to build a new space out of old ones (the pushout). A natural question emerges: can one compute the fundamental group of a pushout from the fundamental groups of the original spaces?

The answer is yes. The Seifert-van Kampen theorem does precisely this.
