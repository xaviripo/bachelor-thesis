# Conclusions

We have high hopes for the synthetic projective plane we are postulating.
All the clues have been pointing to this construction being correct, and perhaps more important, being "in the style" of homotopy type theory.
Unfortunately, more recently we have also been encountering the reasons why this kind of synthetic types are not popular: higher paths are complex to work with from a foundational point of view.
Nonetheless, we will still eagerly try to complete the proof, and even have some ideas on how to generalize it to higher projective spaces.

One of our objectives was to use Agda as an aid for learning homotopy type theory.
Using a machine turns out to be of big use: the compiler is blunt and does not forgive any mistake.
The learning path with a proof assistant can feel like pushing a boulder up a hill, but the error messages at every wrong step help correct misguided intuitions.

As to the use of computer assistance in algebraic topology, it is clear there is still a ton of research to be made.
Developing a formal system to write proofs on the computer is just the first step.
Intuitionistic type theory and, in particular, homotopy type theory, are not capable of coming up with proofs on their own, but they are a step necessary in order to work in this direction.
It is up to us, mathematicians and computer scientists, to make proper use of these ideas.
Software and hardware verification is already a common practice.
Verifying mathematical proofs could very easily become part of our day to day work.
